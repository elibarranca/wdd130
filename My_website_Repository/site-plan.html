      <h3>Home page - Main objective</h3>
      <p>
        [For this assignment I will create a repository web page for my schoolwork and projects. In the corporate world of software engineering, I will face a competitive field where I must demonstrate my ability and experience to future employers, therefore I need to have the ability to show and share my progress in the academic and professional area, so in my repository I will store and demonstrate each significant assignment that I develop during my major.
        My digital repository will be a webpage that is connected to my GitHub page, which might already be an established repository, but  the style and way of displaying the folders does not invite you to discover what is there, so my project will have a little bit of me, it will be organized in a way that demonstrates my style, my talents, my accomplishments, and the goals I want to achieve. To achieve this, I must design a page that is accessible to anyone who is interested, each project must have a description of the process and objective that was involved in its creation, the tools and technologies that I used, the problems and challenges that I faced, and the way in which I solved to have these results.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Personal growth through projects ]</h3>
      <p>
        [It is important that I not only demonstrate the finished product, but also the code that I built, with notes that will help me when I consult them for future work and brief instructions on how to run the program, and since this is a page that I plan to continue using In the long term, I must have notes that remind me what I was working on at that moment, since I will be linking most of what I do, from the simple and small works to the most elaborate and significant works or teamwork, like what I have done with student societies for example.
        Taking this into account, I should also have personal reflections that help me remember the goals I had at each stage of my development as a software engineer, I will have to start documenting the lessons I am facing and the challenges I had at that time, perhaps It wouldn't be something that would be attractive to an employer so I might store it on a subpage that doesn't have as much visibility as the others or I might put it last or I might not include it at all

      </ul>
      <h3>[Technical aspects]</h3>
      <p>
        [Something that I should not forget is that my repository is that it is something that my classmates and teachers will see, so it can be a good tool to give me opportunities to talk, to ask for advice, to share my doubts about new challenges and work as a team to continue achieving more things, so I can be constantly updating it and I will easily teach it to companies where I apply for jobs and internships.
        My site will have a main page where there are links to subpages and the best works in which I have participated are shown, I plan to make at least two subpages where there are links to the other works and have brief descriptions, and on the other subpage there will be more text and images about what I have reflected on throughout my career.
